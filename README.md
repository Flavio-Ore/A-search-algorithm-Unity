The system uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between an enemy (AI) and the player in a 3D environment. First, a grid representing the map is created and obstacles are marked. Then, the AI requests a path to the player's current position. The A* algorithm calculates the optimal route while avoiding obstacles. Finally, the AI follows this path point by point to reach the player, updating the route periodically.
